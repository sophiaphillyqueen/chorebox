char *chorebox_apend_string ( char **rg_a, char *rg_b );
// This function appends (by copy )the contents of the string <rg_b>
// onto the end of the string <rg_a>.
//   The program fails with error in the event of a memory allocation
// failure - or if <rg_a> is null. Otherwise, what can go wrong?
//   The return value is the new value of <*rg_a>.
//   And the only way this will be NULL is if both <rg_b> and the
// going-in value of <*rg_a> are NULL.

bool chorebox_check_cmd_file ( char *rg_a );
// Given the filename <rg_a>, this function does the best it can
// to determine if it is a valid location of an executable - and
// returns a boolean that indicates -true- if the answer is yes.
//   Earlier implementations of this function may only be able
// to test for the existence of a file --- but hopefully, later
// implementations may actually be able to assess the file's
// executability (as in, permissions).

chorebox_str_list *chorebox_colsep_to_list ( char *rg_a );
// The argument is a list (generally one of directories) stored as
// a C string formatted in the manner of the PATH environment variable.
// This function generates a <chorebox_str_list> linked-list rendition
// of that same list, and returns a pointer to that linked-list.

void chorebox_command_line ( int rg_a, char **rg_b, char **rg_c );
// This function should be called very early on in the game from
// the main() function so that the libchorebox library (as well as
// any functions outside that library that use it) can see the
// contents of the command-line and environment.
// <rg_a> should be main()'s <argc> --> save to <chorebox_argc>
// <rg_b> should be main()'s <argv> --> save to <chorebox_argv>
// <rg_c> should be main()'s <env> ---> save to <chorebox_env>
// The return value is "void" because, if used properly, there should
// be nothing at all for this function to report back.

void chorebox_exec_a ( char *rg_a, chorebox_str_list *rg_b );
// This it the basest (i.e. closest to the system) of all the
// chorebox_exec_*() functions - of which all other functions
// of this group are mere wrappers.
//   The first argument is the location of a file that can
// be executed -- the second one is a <chorebox_str_list>
// representation of the command-line that the executable
// (be it a binary or a "#!"-qualified script) will be
// run with.
//   This function does not consult PATH because if that must
// be done, it is the job of a wrapper function to do so.

void chorebox_exec_b ( chorebox_str_list *rg_a );
// As with all the chorebox_exec_*() functions, this one does an
// exec based on a string-list - in this case in argument <rg_a>.
// If the first item on the list is free of any forward-slash
// characters, it will attempt to resolve the location of the
// command along the PATH environment variable.

void chorebx_free_dyn_string ( char **rg_a );
// This function wraps the free() function for a dyn-alloc
// string. As is seen, the argument is a character-handle
// rather than a character pointer. This is so that if
// the string given to it isn't a NULL string, then after
// the free() operation, it can be *set* to NULL.

void chorebox_free_str_list ( chorebox_str_list *rg_a );
// This function frees an entire <chorebox_str_list> linked-list
// of strings -- freeing up the memory for some other use.

void chorebox_getcwd ( char **rg_a );
// This function stores in the dyn-alloc string <rg_a> the full
// location of the Present Working Directory. The only things
// that could cause this function to fail are weird things such
// as memory-allocation failures upon which this function would
// rather terminate the program with error than return in disgrace.
//   The return-value is the char-pointer-type reference to the
// exiting-value of <rg_a> - and is provided just in case that is
// found as a more convenient way of using this function in some
// contexts.
// SEE FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
//   http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?getcwd+3
// as well as:

char *chorebox_join_string ( char *rg_a, char *rg_b );
// This function takes two strings and returns their concatenated
// value. The return value will be NULL if and *only* if *both*
// of the *arguments* are NULL.
//   In the event of a memory-allocation failure, this function
// will not return, but will terminate the program with error.

void *chorebox_mlc (size_t size);
// This function behaves just like malloc() with one exception.
// If it fails, instead of returning NULL, it terminates the
// whole program with error -- using the <libchorebox> info
// regarding the command-line to format the error.
//   This function does *not* implement memory-allocation on
// it's own -- but rather, it does it's job as a *wrapper*
// function for malloc() - so that the memory block that it
// returns is of the same kind that malloc() would returned,
// and (if and when the time comes) can be released in the
// same manner (with free()).
//   This function is to be used in situations where there is
// not much point in the program continuing if the memory
// allocation fails and returning to the calling function at
// all in such an event would only put on the calling function
// the burden of having to check for success-or-failure of
// the memory-allocation.
//   Granted - there are some times when the value of the
// programming continuing is well-worth the burden of checking
// whether or not the memory-allocation operation succeeded -
// but the possibility of calling malloc() *directly* in those
// situations is not hindered by the fact that there is now
// this wrapper-function for *other* situations.

char *chorebox_run_from_path ( char *rg_a, char *rg_b );
// This function takes an executable named in <rg_a> and
// tries to find it's location in the local filesystem. The
// search path is specified by <rg_b> -- not by environment
// variable reference, but by actual contents.
//   This function returns NULL if it fails on account of
// none of the possible-locations passing it's test.
//   As with many functions here, this function will not
// return at all, but terminate the program with failure
// instead, if it fails on account of a memory allocation
// failure.
//   NOTE: This function not only does string allocation
// during it's internal calculations (which it does) but
// the string it returns upon success is *always* something
// it dynamically allocated. Even if it is verbatim to the
// string in <rg_a>, it is still a copy and not the same
// copy of the string.

bool chorebox_samestrg_c ( char *rg_a, char *rg_b );
// This function returns -true- if the two C strings are identical
// and -false- if they are not.

bool chorebox_str_lis_apnd ( chorebox_str_list **rg_a, char *rg_b );
// Apends a -copy- of the string specified in <rg_b> onto the end
// of the string-list specified in <rg_a>. If it fails because
// of memory allocation, the function will not return, but end
// the program with failure. On the other hand, if it fails because
// <rg_b> is NULL, it will simply do nothing, and return -false-.
// (If <rg_b> is an empty-string though, unlike with NULL, that is
// *not* a cause for failure.) If the function succeeds, it will
// return -true-.

void chorebox_str_lis_dump ( chorebox_str_list **rg_a, chorebox_str_list **rg_b );
// Transfers everything in list <rg_a> onto the *end* of the list
// <rg_b>. The result will be that the new <rg_b> list will in
// effect be the old <rg_b> list followed by the old <rg_a> list
// while the new <rg_a> list will be empty.
//   Nothing to report back since I can't see anything going wrong
// if this is used properly --- and if used improperly, I can't
// see any problem that I'd be able to error-handle.
